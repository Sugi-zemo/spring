            <p>
                One day, two best friends were walking on a lonely and dangerous path through a jungle.
                As the sun began to set, they grew afraid but held on to each other. Suddenly, they saw a bear in their path.
                One of the boys ran to the nearest tree and climbed it in a jiffy. The other boy did not know how to climb the tree by himself,
                so he lay on the ground, pretending to be dead. The bear approached the boy on the ground and sniffed around his head.
                After appearing to whisper something in the boy’s ear, the bear went on its way. The boy on the tree climbed down and asked his
                friend what the bear had whispered in his ear. He replied, “Do not trust friends who do not care for you.”

                <h2> Moral of the Story </h2>
                A friend in need is a friend indeed.
